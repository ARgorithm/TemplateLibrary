 The ARgorithmToolkit can be installed using pip.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install ARgorithmToolkit

---> 100%
Successfully installed ARgorithmToolkit
```
</div>

Auto completion for the shell can be setup by using --install-completion option provided by `Typer`. After that you can get started with your own ARgorithm.

<div class="termy">
```console
$ ARgorithm init hello_world
Creating empty template for hello_world
[SUCCESS]: TEMPLATE GENERATED
refer documentation at https://argorithm.github.io/toolkit/ to learn how to use it
chech out examples at https://github.com/ARgorithm/toolkit/tree/master/examples

$ ls
hello_world.py
```
</div>

This will generate the `.py` file. The  `<name>.py` file will store the code that you will submit to the server hosting all ARgorithms

The `<name>.py` file initially looks like this

```python
import ARgorithmToolkit

def run(**kwargs):
    stateset = ARgorithmToolkit.StateSet()
	
    #
    #	Your code
	#
    
    return
```

Any code you wish to add to this file, can be added using all the tools and classes present in the ARgorithmToolkit but ensure that

1. Your file should have one function which takes `**kwargs` input (refer [here](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/args_and_kwargs.html) to know more about kwargs) that will perform whatever you desire and should return the stateset. You can check out how to use this stateset later in the document.
2. You arenâ€™t using any external modules as support for importing external modules has not yet been added. You are free to create classes and additional functions in your code.

Once you have created your code, you need to create a `<name>.config.json` in which you will describe metadata regarding your argorithm. You can create a blank config file by using the `--config` flag in the `init` command and entering your values. You can also create a `.config.json` later using the `configure` command.

the `<name>.config.json` file is a JSON file storing all the metadata. Below is an example of the config.json for [bubblesort](/toolkit/tutorials/bubblesort). You can understand the `.config.json` file [here](/toolkit/tutorials/config).

```json
{
    "argorithmID": "bubblesort", 
    "file": "bubblesort.py", 
    "function": "run", 
    "parameters": {
        "array" : {
            "description" : "Array to be sorted",
            "type" : "ARRAY",
            "item-type" : "INT"
        }
    }, 
    "example": {
        "array" : [
            6,3,2,4,5,1
        ]
    }, 
    "description": "demonstrate bubble sort"
}
```

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| argorithmID | name of your ARgorithm , this is generally pre filled from when you run the init command. The name of your code file should be *name*.py and the config should be *name*.config.json. [will be fixed later] |

| function    | The function that is going to be called                      |
| parameters  | the parameters that your ARgorithm would need, this helps in anyone using your ARgorithm to understand what is the input format |
| example     | default parameters in case no parameters are passed          |
| description | The description of ARgorithm. Helpful to people using your ARgorithm as well as other developers |

## Using ARgorithmToolkit

ARgorithmToolkit adds a few extra steps when it comes to initializing instances whose states you wish to record because a lot of data has to be maintained to be able to provide smooth transitions.

```python hl_lines="1-3"
>>> import ARgorithmToolkit
>>> algo = ARgorithmToolkit.StateSet()
>>> x = ARgorithmToolkit.Variable('x',algo,0,comments='Our first variable')
>>> x.value
0
>>> x.value += 10
>>> x.value
10
>>> print(algo)
{
	'state_type': 'variable_declare', 
	'state_def': {'variable_name': 'x', 'value': 0},
    'comments': 'Our first variable'
}
{
	'state_type': 'variable_highlight', 
	'state_def': {'variable_name': 'x', 'value': 10},
	'comments': ''
}
```

As ARgorithm is tool for creating visual demonstration, you can add comments to most functions. These comments get included in states and are featured as text when that state is rendered in AR.

Ensure that you design the objects you want to keep track of as part of the same stateset. Each object is instantiated with a **name** to be able to identify arrays when rendering them.

Please refer to the docs and samples present in the [repo](https://github.com/ARgorithm/toolkit) to understand better.



## StateSet

The core class to all algorithms and data structures in ARgorithmToolkit.
An object of this class will always be needed when using different ARgorithmToolkit features. This is where the states are stored that later get rendered to the ARgorithm App. So, all the ARgorithms are supposed to return this.

You won't have to interact with it much other than while initialising objects and returning results.
It has an `add_comment` method that allows you to create blank states carrying description in the form of comments that you might want to show to the client while the ARgorithm is being rendered. This will prove handy when creating good demonstrations.

```python
>>> import ARgorithmToolkit
>>> algo = ARgorithmToolkit.StateSet()
>>> algo.add_comment("Hello world")
>>> print(algo)
{'state_type': 'comment', 'state_def': None, 'comments': 'Hello world'}
```
