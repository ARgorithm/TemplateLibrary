# Fibonacci

This tutorial looks towards creating an AR visualisation of the fibonacci sequence with arrays using ARgorithm.  It is advised you go through the [previous tutorial](/toolkit/tutorials/bubblesort) to understand this better.

## Writing the code

The Fibonacci sequence is a very popular beginnerâ€™s problem to explain the concepts of recursion and dynamic programming. In this example, we will be implementing an iterative approach. The `ARgorithmToolkit` class that we'll be using in this example is [`Variable`](/toolkit/api/utils.html#ARgorithmToolkit.utils.Variable). 

```Python
{!../../examples/fibonacci.py!}
```

The `Variable` class is a little different from the other classes and interfaces in ARgorithmToolkit. This class does not have any functionality other than to remember the states of objects of datatypes like `int`,`float`,`string`,`bool`. It is advised to use this only when you need a particular variable rendered in augmented reality  that can prove helpful to understanding the code.

!!! warning
	Be careful when reading or writing the value of the `Variable` class.
	```python hl_lines="4 7"
    >>> var = ARgorithmToolkit.Variable("var",algo,1)
    >>> var
    Variable(1)
    >>> var.value = 3
    >>> var
    Variable(3)
    >>> var = 3
    >>> var
    3
	``` 
	Directly assigning values to the `Variable` object will overwrite the object and states will no longer be recorded for it.

In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of its previous two Fibonacci numbers. We'll be using two variables to store the previously generated Fibonacci.

$$
F\mathbf(n) = F\mathbf(n-1) + F\mathbf(n-2)
$$

```Python  hl_lines="10 15 18-19 21-22"
{!../../examples/fibonacci.py!}
```

## Setting up the config file

For this code, we only need one parameter that is `n` which is the index of the number required in the sequence. We will provide the default value for `n` as 4. As shown in [previous tutorial](/toolkit/tutorials/bubblesort), you can create this using your code editor or the `configure` command [(how to use configure)](/toolkit/tutorials/config)
```json
{!../../examples/fibonacci.config.json!}
```

Finally, we can submit the file to the server.
<div class="termy">
```console
$ ARgorithm submit fibonacci
[SUCCESS]: FILES FOUND
[SUCCESS]: FILES VERIFIED
[SUCCESS]: SUBMITTED
```
</div>
