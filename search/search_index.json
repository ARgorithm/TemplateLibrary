In recent times , there has been a rise in interest in programming education and this tool is bring Augmented reality into the mix by making it easy to make dynamic complex visualization in augmented reality that are accessible to everyone free of cost. How does it work ? The project consists of three parts toolkit Server Mobile application The toolkit package is for developers who want to transport their own algorithms into augmented reality. The toolkit provides you with a template library which works just like your usual template library except this one records states . Each state is an event that occurs in your data structure and by keeping track of the states of your variables , data structures etc we then render them in augmented reality. The server takes the ARgorithm and runs it with custom user input to generate states which the mobile application converts to AR visualizations. The code used to create these visualizations is called argorithm . The people interacting with the project have been classified into programmer and user . The programmer creates and manages argorithm. The user interact with augmented reality visualizations of argorithm .","title":"Home"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/","text":"0.0.12 \u00b6 Linkedlist and DoublyLinkedList have been implemented Command line interface migrated from argparse and wasabi to Typer Shifted documentation from sphinx to mkdocs for better functionality 0.0.11 \u00b6 CLI now can be configured to connect to Server endpoint of choice Documentation pages added Introduction to ARgorithm Server Setup Getting started Alabaster theme for RTD customized 0.0.10 \u00b6 Following Data structures implemented Strings Vector Arrays (one-dimensional as well as multidimensional) Queue Stack Priority Queue Command line interface ready for basic server commands as well helper commands for ARgorithm Creation Programmer actions supported Server admin actions added Documentation Generated from doc strings and hosted","title":"Releases"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#0012","text":"Linkedlist and DoublyLinkedList have been implemented Command line interface migrated from argparse and wasabi to Typer Shifted documentation from sphinx to mkdocs for better functionality","title":"0.0.12"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#0011","text":"CLI now can be configured to connect to Server endpoint of choice Documentation pages added Introduction to ARgorithm Server Setup Getting started Alabaster theme for RTD customized","title":"0.0.11"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#0010","text":"Following Data structures implemented Strings Vector Arrays (one-dimensional as well as multidimensional) Queue Stack Priority Queue Command line interface ready for basic server commands as well helper commands for ARgorithm Creation Programmer actions supported Server admin actions added Documentation Generated from doc strings and hosted","title":"0.0.10"},{"location":"cli/","text":"Command line interface \u00b6 The command line interface for ARgorithmToolkit helps programmers to create and manage their argorithms along with control and manage their server. $ ARgorithm --help Usage: ARgorithm [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

These comments get included in states and get featured as text when that state is rendered in AR. Make sure you make the objects you want to keep track of as part of the same stateset.
